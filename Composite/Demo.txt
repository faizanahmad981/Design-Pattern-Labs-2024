Understanding the Code:
Component Interface (Component.java):

This interface defines the common operations that both leaf and composite components must implement.
Operations include operation(), addChild(), removeChild(), and hasChildren().
Container Class (Container.java):

This class represents the composite component in the Composite pattern.
It implements the Component interface, allowing containers to be treated polymorphically as components.
It contains a list of child components and implements methods to add, remove, and operate on these children.
The operation() method iterates over its children, calling their operation() methods recursively to construct the composite structure.
Leaf Class (Leaf.java):

This class represents the leaf component in the Composite pattern.
It implements the Component interface, allowing leaves to be treated polymorphically as components.
It defines the operation() method to perform a specific operation for a leaf component. In this case, it simply returns "Leaf".
Since a leaf has no children, addChild(), removeChild(), and hasChildren() methods are implemented with no operation.
Composite Class (Composite.java):

This class contains the main method and acts as the client in the Composite pattern.
It demonstrates the usage of composite components by creating a tree structure consisting of both leaf and composite components.
It creates instances of leaf and container components, adds them to the composite structure, and performs operations on them.
Flow of the Code:
Creating Components:

The main method in the Composite class begins by creating instances of leaf (Leaf) and composite (Container) components.
Building Composite Structure:

Containers (Container) are used to create a tree-like structure by adding child components (both leaf and container) to them.
Operation Execution:

The operation() method is called on the root container (tree), which in turn calls operation() on its child components recursively.
Each component (both leaf and container) performs its specific operation, and for containers, it combines the results of child operations.
Printing Output:

The result of the operation is printed to the console, displaying the composite structure formed and the operations performed.
Why Use the Composite Design Pattern:
Uniformity:

The Composite pattern allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
Both leaf and composite components implement the same interface, enabling clients to interact with them in a consistent manner.
Tree-like Structures:

It's useful when dealing with hierarchical tree-like structures where components can have child components, and those children can, in turn, be composites or leaves.
Simplified Client Code:

It simplifies client code by abstracting away the differences between individual and composite objects.
Clients can operate on complex structures without needing to know the internal details of the objects they're dealing with.
