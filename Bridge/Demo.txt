Overview of Bridge Design Pattern:
The Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It is useful when you need to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation, allowing them to vary independently.

Classes and Usage of Bridge Pattern in the Provided Code:
Device Interface (Abstraction):

This interface represents the abstraction in the Bridge pattern.
It defines the operations that can be performed on the device, such as enabling/disabling, adjusting volume, changing channels, and printing status.
Tv and Radio Classes (Refined Abstractions):

These classes implement the Device interface.
They represent concrete implementations of devices (TV and radio) that can be controlled.
Remote Interface (Implementor):

This interface represents the implementor in the Bridge pattern.
It defines the operations that can be performed by a remote control, such as toggling power, adjusting volume, and changing channels.
BasicRemote Class (Concrete Implementor):

This class implements the Remote interface.
It provides a basic remote control implementation that can control a device by delegating calls to the device's methods.
AdvancedRemote Class (Extended Concrete Implementor):

This class extends the BasicRemote class.
It adds additional functionality to the basic remote, such as muting the device.
Bridge Class (Client):

The Bridge class contains the main method and acts as the client in the Bridge pattern.
It demonstrates how the bridge pattern is used by creating instances of devices (TV and radio) and testing them with basic and advanced remotes.
Usage of Bridge Pattern:
The Bridge pattern is used in this scenario to decouple the abstraction (remote control) from its implementation (device control).
The Device interface acts as the abstraction, defining the methods that can be performed on devices.
The Remote interface acts as the implementor, defining the methods that can be performed by remote controls.
The BasicRemote and AdvancedRemote classes provide concrete implementations of remotes, which can control devices by delegating calls to their methods.
By using the Bridge pattern, you can easily extend the system by adding new types of devices or remote controls without modifying existing classes. For example, you can add a new type of device (e.g., DVD player) or a new type of remote control (e.g., smartphone app) without changing the existing code.
